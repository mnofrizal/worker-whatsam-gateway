# Current Project Context

## Project Status: **IN PROGRESS**

This is a greenfield project for a comprehensive **WhatsApp Gateway PaaS**. The workspace is currently being built. The memory bank contains detailed specifications for all components: Frontend, Backend, and Worker.

## Current State

### What Exists

- **Detailed Briefs:** Comprehensive project specifications for the entire PaaS and the individual worker component.
- **Architecture Plan:** Complete technical architecture for the entire system, including data flow diagrams.
- **Development Phases:** A multi-week development plan outlining the implementation of each service.
- **WhatsApp Worker v1:** The initial version of the worker is complete, with core Baileys integration and API endpoints.

### What Needs to Be Built

- **Dashboard Frontend:** A Next.js application for user and admin management.
- **Backend API Gateway:** A Node.js/Express application for orchestration and API management.
- **WhatsApp Worker (Phase 2+):** Storage integration, service communication, and advanced features.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, and database setup.

## Immediate Next Steps

The next phase of development is to integrate the worker with the storage layer.

### Phase 2: Storage Integration (Week 2)

- Integrate with MinIO for session storage.
- Implement session persistence and recovery mechanisms.
- Handle multiple sessions in a single worker.
- Implement session cleanup on disconnect.
- Test database connectivity.

## Current Focus

**Priority 1:** Implement session persistence using MinIO.

- This is crucial for making the worker stateless and scalable.
- Ensures that sessions are not lost if a worker instance fails.

## Blockers & Considerations

- A running MinIO instance is required for development and testing.
- The database connection needs to be configured.
